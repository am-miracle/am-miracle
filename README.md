# ReadMe

I’m a software developer and technical writer with a strong focus on frontend development and Web3 technologies. I help companies build responsive user interfaces using various web technologies like React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, etc. Alongside that, I’m also a technical writer at LogRocket, where I write in-depth articles on JavaScript, React, and Web3, tailored for audiences ranging from beginners to advanced developers.

I worked with companies like Kreatoors Khoomi, ICOWEB Agency, and Daabo, contributing to various platforms like eCommerce, insurance tech platforms, etc. My main strengths lie in building intuitive UIs, writing docs,ds documenting APIs, collaborating across teams, and making complex technical topics accessible through writing.

Right now, I’m diving deeper into smart contract development with Solidity, especially focused on improving security practices and understanding how to build reliable dApps. I'm also like contributing to exicting **open-source** projects on Web3 space either through writing or code. 

I have experience workings with various programming languages like Javascript, Typescript, Solidity, Move, Rust.

Outside work, I’m really into football, kickboxing, and weightlifting — they help me stay focused and disciplined.
